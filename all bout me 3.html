        <p> Considering the fact that I will start my first year of highschool this fall, i dont know what I plan to do after. I have not explored my interest for a future career. Since freshman year is a big change from middle school I will spend my freshman year figuring myself out. All I can say now is after highschool, I hope to start college locally, then move depending on what career I want to do.</p>

        <p> Although, I enjoy to do may things, my all time favorite hobbies are playing soccer and arts and crafts. I started playing soccer when I was 8 years old and I currently play for the Sf Seals.

        <p> As much as I enjoy playing soccer, I also really enjoy doing arts and crafts. It calms me, it's easy, and Im good at it :) </p>
